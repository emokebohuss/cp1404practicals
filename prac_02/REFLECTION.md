# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100% of where we're up to - I loved the videos in CP1401 and I know they are incredibly valuable.
Some videos I've watched offline (downloaded) so it may not show in Learn JCU.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

Thursday mornings at home, about 4 hours so I can do the 'Do this' exercises.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Watching videos and doing all to do exercises, as well as having a play in the pycharm console / terminal.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I couldn't attend the first two weeks of in-person classes which is a shame because I am very excited about this subject
I will be coming to class to actively participate and receive feedback.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I usually write most of pracs earlier in the week, then spend way too much time reviewing it in the last minute.
I will aim to review and submit quicker, so I don't have to start from the beginning every time.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I use the resources given such as the patterns page and I rewatch the videos if i'm unsure how to proceed in my code.
