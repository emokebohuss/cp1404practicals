# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

- Overall accuracy: 58.23%
- Median error in estimation: 6 minutes
- I tend to underestimate on programs that have input handling or need loading and formatting data from a file. E.g.
  emails.py, wimbledon.py
- I usually overestimate on programs that seemed larger at first glance but once I understood the task, it took me a lot
  less time to complete (project_management.py, word_occurrences.py)
- My estimates were most accurate on short programs, especially Classes. (guitar.py, project.py and guitar_test.py)

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

During week 5, my estimates were way over or under (by 30-50%).
In week 6 and 7, most of my estimates were very close to the actual time worked, except for the project_management.py
file, which I overestimated heavily.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

It is an important skill to be able to estimate your work on a task for time management in a personal, academic or
professional setting so you can meet expectations and plan accordingly.
Reviewing the estimates is a great way to discover any underlying patterns and indentify where I may lack practice.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

- Everyone has a different style
- Others' reviews can help me gain a different perspective in writing code I would have not otherwise discovered

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

- I like reviewing!
- It can be intimidating but opens up space for constructive feedback from both sides

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.
