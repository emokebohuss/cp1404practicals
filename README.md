# CP1404 Practicals - Emoke Bohuss
Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

## About me:
I am a 2nd year IT student at JCU. I love programming and surfing. Not at the same time!

### 3  lessons I've learnt about clean code in this subject:
    - Always follow PEP8 style guide
    - Always follow naming conventions (unless you're just playing in the console and want to be efficient)
    - Code reviews help you become a better programmer

Two VERY important pages to help me do well in this subject
are [Programming Patterns](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns)
and [Practical Instructions](https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals/blob/master/README.md)
